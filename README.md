# FDI_DATA
The  package includes the data used in Figures 1 to 4 in the paper.
Since the raw data of the ionosonde is quite large and difficult to upload, the echo data of the Es layer after pulse compression and accumulation is released here. 
The data of high-resolution imaging results using the FDI method are also included.
All data can be imported and viewed directly by MATLAB with the function of "imagesc".
